This project provides a Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Build Service.

## Go Version Compatibility

This module aims to maintain support for the two most recent stable versions of Go. This corresponds to the Go [Release Maintenance Policy](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle#release-maintenance) and [Security Policy](https://golang.org/security), ensuring critical bug fixes and security patches are available for all supported language versions.

## scs-build

### Overview

`scs-build` is a tool for invoking [Sylabs Cloud](https://cloud.sylabs.io)
and Singularity Enterprise Remote Build without the need for installing and
configuring Singularity. It is intended to be integrated into a CI/CD workflow.

### Usage

#### Build and download artifact

```sh
scs-build build --auth-token ${SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN} docker://alpine alpine_latest.sif
```

#### Build and push to default cloud library (cloud.sylabs.io)

```sh
scs-build build --auth-token ${SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN} alpine.def library:user/default/alpine:latest
```

#### Build and push to local Singularity Enterprise

```sh
scs-build build --auth-token ${SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN} alpine.def \
    library://cloud.enterprise.local/user/default/alpine:latest
```

#### Build ephemeral artifact

```sh
export SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx
scs-build build alpine.def
```

`SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN` is obtained through "Access Tokens" in Sylabs Cloud web UI.

#### Build ephemeral artifact in local Singularity Enterprise

```sh
export SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx
scs-build build --url https://cloud.enterprise.local alpine.def
```

#### Build ephemeral artifact using Docker image

```sh
export SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx
docker run -e SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN="${SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN}" scs-build:latest build docker://alpine
```

### CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions

Be sure to create a secret named `SYLABS_AUTH_TOKEN` containing token obtained from "Access Tokens" in [Sylabs Cloud](https://cloud.sylabs.io).

See [examples/github-actions-ci.yaml](examples/github-actions-ci.yaml) for an example configuration.

#### GitLab

Example [gitlab-ci.yml](examples/gitlab-ci.yml) is configured to build using file `alpine.def` contained within the project directory.

This example configuration will store the build artifact (in this case, `artifact.sif`) within GitLab. Using a library reference (ie. `library:myuser/myproject/image`) will result in the build artifact automatically being pushed to [Sylabs Cloud](https://cloud.sylabs.io) or a local Singularity Enterprise installation.
